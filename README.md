# html-css-git-challenge

## Description
### In this challange I improved the accessibility of the Horiseon website by adding alternative texts to all informative images, creating a descriptive title, and organizing the strutcture of the HTML elements and the heading attributes in sequential order. I also refactored the existing code by reducing repition in the CSS code and fixing any issues such as linking the search engine optimization button in the navigation to the SEO section in the content section.
